            <p>There is no app. There is no swiping.</p>
            <p> Put simply this is a fun social experiment we designed to test 
                whether or not online dating is flawed by design or by intention.By the end of it we hope that you'll finally have the answer to 
                question we all subconciously ask ourselves: is there someone out there like me?</p>

                    during the structured interaction period, either virtually or in person.</li>

            <h2>How it works?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Answer the 101 weird ass questions created to help us create pick your most compatible matches and a dope profile.
                Think date me doc but wayyy more fun. For the oversharers this is your time to shine. </li>
                <li>Optional: "Zero Rizz Academy" prep assignments</li>
                <li>On Sunday, July XX we'll text you the profiles of 2-3 matches. Most communication from this point on will be through text only.</li>
                <li>Over the next two months you will spend time getting to know them.</li>
                <li>At the end of the 2 month period we will ask you which, if any, you are interested in still talking to and 
                    who you are not interested in. We will send a message conveying the following on your behalf. Then you will receive 
                    a new match to replace the one's you are no longer interested in. You will also fill out a brief survey about your experience with each person that we will use to determine someone's eligibility to stay active. </li>
                <li>This cycle will repeat every two months. Note: a match cannot be retained for more than two cycles, the end of the second cycle you will either commit to an exclusive relationship and your profile will be paused 
                    and all other matches removed, or we will autosend a "no longer interested" to them on your behalf.</li>
